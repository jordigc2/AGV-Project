# AGV-Project
1st Semester project of AS Aalborg University

This project consits of developing an AGV from scratch and make it move autonomously around a scenario, which represents a warehouse. The task of the AGV is to collect all the components needed in order to assembled the products orderd. In order to complete this tasks the ROS has been used with python in order to compute the control and scheduling operations.

In the AGV5 folder is stored a copy of all the code running in the Raspberry Pi and in the Arduino.

In the Code folder is the tests and the previous versions of the code before running it to the AGV.

In the Documentation folder it is possible to find the Final_Report.pdf file, where all the project is developed.

In the following link it is shown the demo of the final result: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mAgV4dfHYj0dvF18u0FF1XAJI0c6vV-G
